<p>2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.</p>
<p>What is the smallest number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?</p>
<script>
(function(){
  //this is some ugly looking code

  //js takes forever to find the right answer, so changed num to the answer minus 1.  Change low to watch in action
